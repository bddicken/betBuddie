	This is what a Past Performance information form guide looks like for any given horse race.
	Pretty confusing huh?  So many numbers and statistics, can it really be that hard to pick 
	the winning horse? This game will teach you, step-by-step, all you need to know to become 
	a successful handicapper. We cannot promise that you will pick	the winner every time but 
	you will be able to apply your knowledge to make informed wagers in real life wagering situations.
