<div class="title2">What is <span class="title4">BetBuddie</span>? </div>
	
	<div class="paragraph1">
	BetBuddie came about when Race Track Industry students at the University of Arizona teamed up
	with Computer Science students to develop a technology based application to serve the racing
	industry. Both groups of students agreed that that terminology and language used in horse racing
	form guides and wagering can be confusing especially for the novice handicapper. It is hoped that
	BetBuddie can teach the user everything they need to know in order to become a successful handicapper in
	the future.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	BetBuddie does so by slowly introducing the user to terminology that they would see on a horse
	racing form guide. Each level has certain criteria that the user must complete in order to proceed
	to the next level. This may include winning wagers made by the user who will gain the knowledge
	to choose the horse that is most likely to win based on statistics provided by the game. It will be
	possible for the user to make a hypothetical simulation bet on each of the different levels helping
	them understand how each bet works and which bets are best in different situations.
	<br/>
	<br/>	
	It is hoped that BetBuddie can reduce the stress and confusion of handicapping and wagering and allow
	all current and prospective racing fans the chance to make sensible wagers with the knowledge they
	have built up from playing the game.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Each level is filled with descriptions that will educate the user on the various elements in a racecard
	therefore if thereâ€™s a word underlined, clicking it will bring up a description of the underlined word.
	This is shown in the image below.
