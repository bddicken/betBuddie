<h2>About</h2>
BetBuddie came about when Race Track Industry students at the University of Arizona teamed up
with Computer Science students to develop a technology based application to serve the racing
industry. Both groups of students agreed that that terminology and language used in horse racing
form guides and wagering can be confusing especially for the novice handicapper. It is hoped that
BetBuddie can teach the user everything they need to know in order to become a successful handicapper in
the future.
	
BetBuddie does so by slowly introducing the user to terminology that they would see on a horse
racing form guide. Each level has certain criteria that the user must complete in order to proceed
to the next level. This may include winning wagers made by the user who will gain the knowledge
to choose the horse that is most likely to win based on statistics provided by the game. It will be
possible for the user to make a hypothetical simulation bet on each of the different levels helping
them understand how each bet works and which bets are best in different situations.
	
It is hoped that BetBuddie can reduce the stress and confusion of handicapping and wagering and allow
all current and prospective racing fans the chance to make sensible wagers with the knowledge they
have built up from playing the game.

Each level is filled with descriptions that will educate the user on the various elements in a racecard
therefore if thereâ€™s a word underlined, clicking it will bring up a description of the underlined word.
This is shown in the image below.


<h2>Deployment</h2>
This application runs as a web application on Apache web server. To set up the database for the game,
follow the instructions in betBuddie/sql/rtip_game_sim.sql.


<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
This game was developed by a number of students with widely varying experience with web-programming.
Thus, the code is somewhat disorganized and lacking in structure. If time permits, I hope to clean it
up in the future.
